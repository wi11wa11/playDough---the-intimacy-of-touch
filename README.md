# playDough---the-intimacy-of-touch

PlayDough is a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project exploring how an intimate interaction may be created using basic computer coding and prototyping skills. The aim of playDough is to facilitate an interactive, intimate and playful experience, creating a relationship between the human and the computer. 

The design centres around a ball of dough which moves according to the closeness and connection to a userâ€™s hand. When no touch is sensed nearby, the dough twitches randomly as if lost, searching for a connection. A fan also briefly blows strands of paper, reaching out and attracting attention to the dough. When a nearby presence is sensed, the dough frantically twitches, and paper is blown to reach out to the presence. When connection is made between the dough and hand, the paper ceases to move and the dough relaxes and is calm. After a few moments the dough begins to vibrate softly, finding consolation in connecting and forming a bond.
